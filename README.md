## Installation

If you only need to build the front end you don't need to follow all these instructions
these instructions are for creating and connecting appwrite to the Flutter application.
To get started with the Scholars Mobile App, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker:https://www.docker.com/
2. Open CMD and install the AppWrite with Docker: you can find the instructions on the Appwrite Documents.
3. Now open Docker and see whether the appwrite is running on Docker.
4. Go to the web browser and type and search localhost: the port number should be the one you gave in the installation(default one is 80).
5. Create an Appwrite account if you don't have one.
6. Create a new project
7. Create a flutter project.
8. Go to the Dashboard  and add a new flutter platform: the package name can be found in build.gradle file -> default config (for Android)
9. Add dependances(appwrite, cupertino_icons, flutter_riverpod, flutter_svg, fpdart):  `flutter pub add`.
10. Create a Database in Appwrite.
    
Happy coding!!!
